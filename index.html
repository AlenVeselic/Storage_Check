    Storage check, a client side web app that keeps of all inventory in each storage space you may have. If you have items that
    perish over time it also makes sure that when those items are out or are about to run out (minimum amount before notification)
    it assembles a grocery list for you.

        This div is my second means of implementing an interface with the database saved in local storage. At this point you can only walk through the base,
        in the end getting to a list of items within a storage object. The divs within the traversal div are in the order the user would go down a database, most of the work
        being done in JS.

<!--This section is the first way of modifiying/interacting with the underlying database in local storage.
    It has addition and deletion of each separate category(place, room, object, items) and a way of displaying
    the entire inventory tree.

    The implementation of this wasn't that hard, most visual work being with the display and toggling
    the display of each separate modification section. This way of interaction was mostly for testing
    purposes since it seems to visually to "debuggy" and since I'm trying to get this to work well on mobile
    it wouldn't be really that intuitive for that platform. 
    This was my first try at web app development and since before I was trying to make these in Python
    having the gui be in TkInter, it felt a lot easier.-->

<!--
    Another way I tackled modification which felt a bit archaic was having one text field and getting the extra
    information I needed by using dialog prompts and getting the missing info from that. They felt like a bit
    too much and I think getting information can be done more elegantly.
